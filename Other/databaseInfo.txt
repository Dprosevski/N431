ADD:
program manager role needs fix autopostbacks

we are missing the message displaying that the manager is inactive

edit program needs to be masked for unapproved(?) managers

i think its unapproved... maybe inactive too?

edit profile, separate from change password

i'm gonna have to change the session control, too

to make sure ppl can't just type in links

the edit program should've been showing approved, not active

actually, both?

either remove active/inactive or add the approved in the admin box

well we didn't lose all the points at least!

last updated on search result

it literally says on elmer's form put today's date for last updated column but lol

also the dates were appearing but i think because we changed the view its changing how they display on the search page

ONE MORE THING
